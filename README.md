# SciMLFisheries

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jack-h-buckner/SciMLFisheries.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jack-h-buckner/SciMLFisheries.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

SciMLFisheries uses the Julia scientific machine learning ecosystem to build fisheries assessment models. These models combine state-space modeling techniqeus with neural networks to capture the complex ecosystem dynamics that cause changes in fish populalion abundance while accomidating multiple forms of uncertinaty. 

## Getting starterd

SciMLFisheries is still in development and not avaible on the julia registery, but can be accessed through github. To download the pacakge open julia and type the following comands.
```
]add https://github.com/jack-h-buckner/SciMLFisheries.jl
 using SciMLFisheries
```

For more instructions and details on model construction please see the package documentation  https://jack-h-buckner.github.io/SciMLFisheries.jl/dev/.
