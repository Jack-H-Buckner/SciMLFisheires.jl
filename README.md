# SciMLFisheries

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jack-h-buckner/SciMLFisheries.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jack-h-buckner/SciMLFisheries.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

SciMLFisheries uses the julia scientific machine learning ecosystem to build fisheries assessment models. These models combine standard state-space modelign techniqeus with neurla networks to simultaniously account for uncertainty and complex biological dynamics that characterize fisheires data.
