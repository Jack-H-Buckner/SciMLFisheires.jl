Two important goals in fisheries science are understanding how these complex interactions influence fish population dynamics and designing management strategies that account for them. We aim to address this challenge by combining standard fisheries models with novel machine-learning techniques.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"SciMlFisheries","title":"SciMlFisheries","text":"Machine learning methods have been very successful at reconstructing the dynamics of complex systems, including popautlion dynamics. Machine learning techniques have been so effective because they are flexible and, therefore, can represent complex nonlinear interactions when they are present. Machine learning techniques can also incorporate information from past observations to inform predictions, which is very helpful when that data set does not include all relevant state variables. This may often be the case in fisheries science because fish populations are embedded in complex ecosystems and interact with species that may or may not be observed directly.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"SciMlFisheries","title":"SciMlFisheries","text":"Here, we aim to develop new models that combine standard fisheries modeling techniques with machine learning tools to leverage the potential advantages of these methods while accounting for the multiple sources of uncertainty common in fisheries data. The models are built using a surplus production or \"Biomass dynamics‚Äù framework, where machine learning is used to estimate the production function.  These machine learning-based production models can incorporate prior observations that implicitly account for species interactions and other ecosystem feedbacks that operate on extended time scales. Models like these that combine machine learning with parametric models are often called Scientific Machine Learning, which lends its name to our package.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Model-structure","page":"SciMlFisheries","title":"Model structure","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"SciMlFisheries","title":"SciMlFisheries","text":"SciMLFisheries uses a state space modeling framework. State space models are a class of time series models that describe a sequence of observations by combining two models: 1) the process model that describes how the state of a system changes over time, and 2) the data model that describes how the state of a system determines the observations. Combining the two models allows the state space model to account for noisy, imperfectly measured data and random variability in the system state.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"SciMlFisheries","title":"SciMlFisheries","text":"The surplus production models describe two data sources, harvest H_t and a relative abundance index y_t. Using these two data sources, the models estimate two state variables, the population biomass B_t and fishing mortality rate F_t. There are two built-in observation models for the abundance index.

Our modeling framework uses a discrete-time formulation, so biomass and fishing mortality are only estimated at a single point during each period, and we must approximate the integral in the harvest equations.
